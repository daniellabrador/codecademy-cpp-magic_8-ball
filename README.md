# **Magic 8-Ball**

The Magic 8-Ball program is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in using conditional statements using C++.

## Project Prompt

The [Magic 8-Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) is a super popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice, developed in the 1950s!

Write a `magic8.cpp` program that will output a random fortune each time it executes.

The answers inside a standard Magic 8-Ball are:

- `It is certain.`
- `It is decidedly so.`
- `Without a doubt.`
- `Yes - definitely.`
- `You may rely on it.`
- `As I see it, yes.`
- `Most likely.`
- `Outlook good.`
- `Yes.`
- `Signs point to yes.`
- `Reply hazy, try again.`
- `Ask again later.`
- `Better not tell you now.`
- `Cannot predict now.`
- `Concentrate and ask again.`
- `Don't count on it.`
- `My reply is no.`
- `My sources say no.`
- `Outlook not so good.`
- `Very doubtful.`

For example:

```git
MAGIC 8-BALL:
 
It is decidedly so.
```

Or:

``` git
MAGIC 8-BALL:
 
Very doubtful.
```

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `magic8.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

```git
g++ magic8.cpp -o magic8
./magic8
```
